# Frontal face filter settings (MediaPipe)
face_filter:
  enabled: false
  # Yaw thresholds: face is frontal if yaw is between these values
  # Positive = looking right, Negative = looking left
  # More relaxed values = more faces pass through
  yaw_max: 0.40        # Max yaw to right (relaxed from 0.25)
  yaw_min: -0.40       # Max yaw to left (relaxed from -0.25)
  # Pitch thresholds (optional, not strictly enforced for now)
  pitch_max: 0.30      # Max pitch up
  pitch_min: -0.30     # Max pitch down
  # Detection confidence
  min_detection_confidence: 0.20
  # Blur threshold (Laplacian variance - higher = sharper)
  blur_min: 2.0

# Clustering settings (K-Means)
clustering:
  # K-Means auto-detects optimal K using silhouette score
  # min_k and max_k are determined automatically based on data
