# Frontal face filter settings (MediaPipe)
face_filter:
  enabled: true
  # Yaw thresholds: face is frontal if yaw is between these values
  # Positive = looking right, Negative = looking left
  # More relaxed values = more faces pass through
  yaw_max: 0.25        # Max yaw to right (default 0.25 = ~25% turn)
  yaw_min: -0.25       # Max yaw to left
  # Pitch thresholds (optional, not strictly enforced for now)
  pitch_max: 0.30      # Max pitch up
  pitch_min: -0.30     # Max pitch down
  # Detection confidence
  min_detection_confidence: 0.25
  # Blur threshold (Laplacian variance - higher = sharper)
  blur_min: 3.0
