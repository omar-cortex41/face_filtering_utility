# Frontal face filter settings (MediaPipe)
face_filter:
  enabled: true
  # Yaw thresholds: face is frontal if yaw is between these values
  # Positive = looking right, Negative = looking left
  # Stricter = fewer side profiles pass (0.20 = ~20 degrees)
  yaw_max: 0.20        # Max yaw to right (strict)
  yaw_min: -0.20       # Max yaw to left (strict)
  # Pitch thresholds (optional, not strictly enforced for now)
  pitch_max: 0.30      # Max pitch up
  pitch_min: -0.30     # Max pitch down
  # Detection confidence - higher = must detect face clearly
  min_detection_confidence: 0.50
  # Blur threshold (Laplacian variance - higher = sharper)
  blur_min: 5.0

# Clustering settings (K-Means)
clustering:
  # K-Means auto-detects optimal K using silhouette score
  # min_k and max_k are determined automatically based on data
